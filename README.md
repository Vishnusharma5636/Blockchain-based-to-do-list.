## Project Title
Blockchain-based To-Do List

## Project Description
The Blockchain-based To-Do List is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to facilitate the buying, selling, and auctioning of digital art as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This platform empowers artists and collectors by providing a secure and transparent environment for trading digital art. Each piece of art is represented as an NFT on the blockchain, ensuring ownership, provenance, and authenticity. Users can create, list, and bid on digital art pieces, making it a comprehensive marketplace for digital art enthusiasts.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a vibrant ecosystem for digital artists and collectors, where creativity meets technology. We aim to democratize access to digital art by providing a user-friendly platform that leverages blockchain technology for secure transactions and ownership verification. By fostering a community of artists and collectors, we aspire to elevate the status of digital art and create new opportunities for creators worldwide.

## Future Scope
The future scope of the Blockchain-based To-Do List includes:
- **Mobile Application**: Developing a mobile app to allow users to manage their digital art collections and transactions on the go.

- **Integration with Other Marketplaces**: Allowing users to list their NFTs on multiple platforms for greater visibility and sales opportunities.
- **Sustainability Initiatives**: Exploring eco-friendly blockchain solutions to minimize the environmental impact of NFT transactions.
